<b> MenuControl – Solitaire Staff Panel</b>

 Project Overview

MenuControl – Solitaire Staff Panel is a focused, full-stack web application designed to help hotel staff manage and maintain food menu items in a structured and user-friendly interface.

This project simulates the internal staff-side component of a larger hotel dining management system. While hotel in-room dining systems often include order handling, guest interfaces, and payment modules, this project specifically delivers the **core menu control functionality** – allowing staff to perform full **CRUD** operations on menu items.

 Project Scope

Due to limited time and the need to submit a complete and working full-stack application, the scope has been narrowed down to a **staff-only module** that handles menu management. This system can serve as the foundation or backend for a larger in-room dining system in the future.

The project enables hotel staff to:
- Add new food items to the menu
- View all available menu items
- Edit existing food items
- Delete menu items

Features

- Grid-based layout for displaying food items
- Stylish card design with hover effects
- Form-based item creation and editing
- Data stored in a JSON file to simulate a database
- RESTful backend using Express.js

Technologies Used

Frontend:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

Backend:
- Node.js

Data Storage:
- JSON file (used as a lightweight database)
